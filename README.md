In this I have used Python to take user inputs as command line arguments to generate spec-
ified output file(s). 


Problem Statement:
• The Python code must generate an output HTML document named “output.html" in the current working directory.
• The Python program must take as input two parameters as command line arguments.
• The first parameter is either ‘-s’ or ‘-c’. “-s” specifies that the second parameter is a student ID and
“-c” specifies that the second parameter is a course ID.
• The second parameter will be the corresponding student ID or course ID.
